## Priority Recommendation

1. **GPU Workers (High Priority)**
   - This is your core functionality
   - Needed to test the entire pipeline
   - Can validate job queue system

2. **Basic Frontend (High Priority)**
   - Users need to interact with the system
   - Essential for testing user flow
   - Can help identify backend issues

3. **Payment System (Medium Priority)**
   - Required before launch
   - Can use credits system for testing

4. **CDN Setup (Medium Priority)**
   - Important for performance
   - Can be implemented in parallel

5. **Production Setup (Low Priority)**
   - Important but can use development setup initially
   - Focus on functionality first
